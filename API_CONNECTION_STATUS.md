```

### Broken Connections ❌
```
Frontend Component          →  Backend Endpoint
PersonaDashboard (stats)   →  GET /persona/stats ❌
ModuleManager              →  GET /products/{id}/modules ❌
FeatureAssignment          →  GET /features ❌
CustomerInsights           →  GET /customers/ ❌
```

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. Feature System Confusion
- **Epic Features**: Original system for development tracking
- **Module Features**: New system for sales/marketing
- Same Feature table serves both purposes
- `epic_id` is REQUIRED (for development)
- `module_id` is OPTIONAL (for sales/marketing)

### 2. Working Flow
```
1. Create Epic → Create Features (for development)
2. Create Product → Create Modules (for sales)
3. Assign existing Features to Modules (for battle cards)
```

### 3. Critical Missing Connections
- Feature listing is broken (affects assignment UI)
- Module listing is broken (affects module management)
- Stats endpoint is broken (affects dashboard)

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Fix `/features` endpoint** - Critical for feature assignment
2. **Fix `/products/{id}/modules` endpoint** - Critical for module management
3. **Fix `/persona/stats` endpoint** - Important for dashboard

### Frontend Updates Needed:
1. Update `FeatureAssignment.tsx` to handle Epic-based features
2. Add Epic selection when creating features
3. Show Epic context when assigning features to modules

### API Improvements:
1. Add better error handling to prevent 500 errors
2. Add validation for required fields
3. Add proper pagination support
4. Add filtering by epic_id and module_id

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Fix the 500 errors** - Debug and fix database queries
2. **Test feature assignment flow** - Ensure Epic → Feature → Module flow works
3. **Update frontend** - Handle the dual nature of features
4. **Add sample data** - Create test epics, features, and modules
5. **End-to-end testing** - Test complete user journey

The system is **partially functional** but needs these critical fixes to be fully operational.
