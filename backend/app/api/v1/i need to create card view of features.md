i need to create card view of features
card should have title
priortiy score
tags -> not ai enabled
number of occurance -> need to create a search_in_rfp_question() tool and assigne this to agent and it is incuded in feature report and displayed there
new buttong to view full analysis
would be single page
now full analaysis should show custom deman or we can say rfp questions 
we could also get custom name link to that rfs and show a table view samlll in markdown ( forontend tab should render markdown also)
we should competeitiye anlsysis 
in competitivty analsysis we create analsysis againt manageengine,freshservice,haloitsm
same table view what are they giving a descrtipion time in markdown

and other thing can be market trends and future.forecesting also we dont want number only we want detailed with numbers text and table graph possible

in each tab create anlayis button of individaly agent 
in backend call the invideual agent and show its raw in markdown very simple no workaround
